30.10.1997
 - Removed all the unused PC-things...

12.1.1998
 - Removed (or actually #ifdeffed) those hid things (machines.h), executable
   size cut down by more than 100kb!
 - -au option DOES work also with sample rates != 8000. It seems that
   Linux /dev/audio does not care about the sample rate information in .au-file
   header... Take one .au file created by playtzx, convert it with sox to
   .wav, play this with xanim and voila... Looking for better .au player :)
 - Released 0.11
